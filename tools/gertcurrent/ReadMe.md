# A simple tool to sample voltage and current

# Use one of the Adafruit breakout boards with defined resistor and Adafruits lib
# plugs into an I2C port, and tested with EnviroDiy Mayfly 0.5b
# Tested with Adafruit-904/INA219 - resistor 0.1 Ohm
#   Std  26V +-3.2A, resolutuon 0.8mA 
#   Div8 16V +-0.4A, resolution 0.1mA
# Should work with Adafruit-3650/INA219 - resistor 0.1 Ohm
# Also reference:
# Adafruit-4226 using INA260, measures to 36V and 15A - usine 0.002Ohms with 16bit ADC
