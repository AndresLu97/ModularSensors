 * @section tallyCounterI2C_intro Introduction
 * > The Tally is a minimal ultra low power digital event counter, designed to
 * > be a counterpart to a traditional data logger to measure and average rapid
 * > events like an anemometer reading.
 *
 * The [Tally_Library]
 * (https://github.com/NorthernWidget-Skunkworks/Tally_Library/tree/Dev_I2C)
 * is used internally for communication with the Tally.
 *
 *
 * @section tallyCounterI2C_datasheet Sensor Datasheet
 * Documentation for the sensor can be found at:
 * - https://github.com/NorthernWidget-Skunkworks/Project-Tallyâ€‹
 * - https://github.com/NorthernWidget-Skunkworks/Tally_Library/tree/Dev_I2C

 *
 * @section tallyCounterI2C_sensor The Tally Counter Sensor
 * @ctor_doc{TallyCounterI2C, int8_t I2CPower, uint8_t i2cAddressHex}
 * @subsection tallyCounterI2C_timing Sensor Timing
 * - Readings transferred from the reed-switch counting device (i.e. anemometer
 * or tipping bucket) to the logger are from past events, so there is no need
 * to wait for stability or measuring.
 *
 * @section tallyCounterI2C_events Events Output
 *   - Range and accuracy depend on the sensor used
 *     - For wind, we often use [Inspeed WS2R Version II Reed Switch Anemometer]
 *  (https://www.store.inspeed.com/Inspeed-Version-II-Reed-Switch-Anemometer-Sensor-Only-WS2R.htm)
 *   - Result stored in sensorValues[0]
 *   - Resolution is 1 event
 *   - Reported as dimensionless counts
 *   - Default variable code is TallyCounterI2CEvents
