 *This file is part of the EnviroDIY modular sensors library for Arduino

 * Adapted from ApogeeSQ212.h by Sara Damiano (sdamiano@stroudcenter.org) and 

 * This file is for the grove voltage divider (but will work with any voltage divider with an output in the range of 0 ~ 3.3v)
 * This is dependent on the soligen2010 fork of the Adafruit ADS1015 library.
 *
 * The grove voltage divider is a simple voltage divider designed to measure high external voltages on a low voltage
 * ADC. This module employs a variable gain via two pairs of voltage dividers, and a unity gain amplification to reduce output
 * impedance of the module
 *
 * Range is either 0.3 ~ 12.9v (1/gain = 3x), or 1 ~ 43v (1/gain = 10x) 
 * Accuracy is < Â± 1%
 * Resolution:
 *  16-bit ADC: < 0.65 mV
 *
 * Technical specifications for the Grove Voltage Divider can be found at:
 * http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Voltage_Divider/
 *
 * Response time: < 1ms
 * Resample time: max of ADC (860/sec)
